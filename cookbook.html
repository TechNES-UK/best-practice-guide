<h1>Executive Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies are key to
many modern engineering projects due to their ability to solve many problems
that are difficult or impossible with other methods. While most engineers will
find themselves enjoying a significant overlap between these techniques and
their existing skill set, they are also liable to find that AI and Machine
Learning is its own field with its own unique demands and (often hidden)
pitfalls. While there are many resources available for self teaching, it is
generally assumed the practitioner is either an absolute beginner to
engineering, or already a seasoned expert in AI and ML. In this document, we
provide a practical guide to AI and Machine learning for  electronic systems
engineers who already have a strong base of knowledge in electronic systems but
no specialized expertise. This guide will be practice focused, with the goal of
helping engineers to make good decisions and avoid problems. The guide will
cover, among many others areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Preliminary problem assessment</p></li>
<li><p>Data collection</p></li>
<li><p>Pipelining</p></li>
<li><p>Testing and Validation</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy and Security</p></li>
<li><p>Ethical and Legal considerations</p></li>

<h1>Target Audience<a class="headerlink" href="#target-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The target audience for this guide is electronic systems engineers with little
to no specific expertise in AI and Machine Learning techniques. It will be
assumed, because of this background, that readers will have a base level of
competence in programming and mathematics, though the guide will err on the side
of caution in respect of assumed knowledge. We may, for example, assume our
reader has knowledge of concepts in basic calculus, but are unlikely to assume
that they are able to remember any specific formula. We are also assuming that
the primary interest in practically deploying these techniques rather than
understanding the theory and context of their development. For readers
interested in a more theoretical treatment, we list several texts in the
resources section appropriate to a range of different levels of background
knowledge.</p>

<h1>Using this Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#using-this-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This guide provides a preamble discussing the key issues in each section,
followed by a questionnaire for each section dictating, for each AI risk and
privacy level, key steps to take. Where AI and Privacy levels are both
specified, you must fulfill this requirement if you meet either of these
specifications.</p>
<p>In terms of structure, this guide specifies several different categories of
requirements. Creating an effective AI project is an iterative process, and it
is not intended that the ordering of the requirements specifies a strong order
in which to tackle the requirements, beyond the obvious (e.g. we must collect
the data before we can do anything with it). The only exception to this is the
Preliminary Assessment that forms the first step of any project, and establishes
the AI and Privacy risk levels discussed below.</p>
<section id="ai-risk-levels">
<h2>AI Risk Levels<a class="headerlink" href="#ai-risk-levels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the key concepts leveraged in this guide in order to provide an
appropriate level of risk management to AI is the classification of different AI
applications into different risk categories. This framework strongly mimics the
approach proposed in the upcoming EU Artificial Intelligence act, and defines
four categories of risk for AI:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unacceptable risk. Applications that are a clear threat to the safety,
livelihoods or rights of people.</p></li>
<li><p>High risk. Applications that are critical to the safety or wellbeing of
people, that require special mitigations to adequately cover the risks they
pose</p></li>
<li><p>Limited risk. Applications with lower impacts to safety or wellbeing, but
which still require some level of mitigation</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal or no risk. Applications with minimal to zero risk.</p></li>
<li><p>We define these terms in more detail, with examples, in the appendix.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The framework this guide provides dictates different requirements according to
each category.</p>
</section>
<section id="privacy-risk-levels">
<h2>Privacy Risk Levels<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-risk-levels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The other key concepts used in this guide are privacy and security requirements.
As data driven methods, AI and Machine Learning algorithms have the potential to
pose significant risks in these areas. We define three levels of privacy and
security requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>High risk. Applications that deal with personal data that may pose a risk to
the safety or wellbeing of people</p></li>
<li><p>Limited risk. Applications that deal with personal data with lower impacts to
safety or wellbeing, but which still require some level of mitigation</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal or no risk. Applications that either do not deal with personal data,
or do so with minimal to zero risk.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Preliminary Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#preliminary-assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In order to usefully realize the content of this guide, the AI and Privacy risks
that the project poses need to be defined. To do this, we need to undertake
several preliminary steps to define the project.</p>
<p>The very first step is to establish that AI and Machine Learning algorithms are
an effective and suitable approach to the proposed problem. The goals of the
project should be reviewed in the context of what AI and Machine Learning
algorithms can achieve, and compared to other (non AI) approaches. Simpler
approaches may lead to comparable or better results, without the overhead of
managing an AI and Machine Learning project.</p>
<p>The next step is to scope out the goals and requirements of the proposed product
in the context of the business constraints it is subject to. Given the
challenges of validating AI approaches, it is imperative to define clear,
specific goals for the project. When the goals and requirements of the proposed
project have been established, well defined metrics of what success in achieving
these goals will look like need to be created.</p>
<p>Once these goals and metrics are defined, it is then appropriate to undertake a
risk assessment of the project. This risk assessment should, without exception,
inform a fair assessment of the AI risk and privacy risk category that the
proposed projects outcomes fall into.</p>

<section id="data-collection">
<h1>Data Collection<a class="headerlink" href="#data-collection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In all approaches that learn from data, the quality and availability of data are
of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The first step is to establish what kind of data needs to be collected in order
to solve the problem of interest, and where and how it is going to be obtained
at a high quality. It’s important to consider how much data is likely to be
needed to solve the problem while maintaining realistic expectations of what
data is cost effectively obtainable. It’s also important to pick data that both
accurately represents your quality of interest, and is amenable to computation.
AI methods are fundamentally statistical methods that deal with quantitative
data, and subjective measures (e.g. free text answers) are substantially more
difficult to manage. Whatever is decided, it is important to consider and record
factors that may impact data quality, or introduce sampling biases.</p>
<p>The process of establishing a data collection pipeline should be an iterative
process: it is unlikely the first solutions to the above questions will be the
best ones. Data exploration should be undertaken to establish interesting
patterns, and to identify problems in the data (and remedies thereto) as early
as possible. Note that it is possible to introduce biases by doing this
carelessly. Even with a carefully designed data pipeline, data will, almost
universally, require preprocessing before it is handed off to any AI pipeline.
It may, for example, require cleaning, transformation, and/or labeling. This
step may be revisited in light of later processing stages, but should still be
carried out at this stage. In all instances, it is imperative that the processes
used to achieve this are tracked and can be replicated. Raw collected data
should be permanently stored where practicable for limited risk projects, or
always for high risk projects.</p>
<p>The risk level and privacy requirements of the AI application may dictate
additional steps. All projects should undertake a risk assessment on the
potential risks and harms the data collection process may cause, but High risk
projects must further provide an appropriate mitigation strategy to reduce
identified harms, and human oversight. High risk projects must also take
adequate steps at the data collection stage to screen data for biases that may
cause discriminatory outcomes of the AI and Machine Learning algorithm. Projects
with high privacy requirements must take extra steps at this stage to ensure
that data is kept properly secured and anonymized, in addition to the ones
specified in the “Privacy and Security” section.</p>
